# Chapter 1 – Trials of the Puritan House

The Initiate now steps into the ancient halls of the **Puritan House**, where the very foundations of computational thinking are engraved in sacred lines of C code. Here, logic is law, and structure is survival.

This chapter focuses on mastering the fundamentals of programming through the C language. Each trial is both a technical exercise and a symbolic rite, forged by the House’s strict traditions.
