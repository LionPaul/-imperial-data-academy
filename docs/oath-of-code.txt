OATH OF CODE  
Imperial Data Academy | Codex 001-A

I swear, under the eyes of the Magister and the Throne of Data,  
to never compile in ignorance,  
to never version in chaos,  
to never traverse undocumented paths.

I shall write with purpose, and refactor with clarity.  
My code shall be readable, my data clean,  
my logic sound, my models just.

Where others guess, I will analyze.  
Where others copy, I will understand.  
Where others give up, I will persist.

Silence shall guide my mind,  
discipline shall shape my workflow,  
and learning shall be my eternal directive.

I pledge to wield the power of data not for vanity,  
but for insight, growth, and the advancement of knowledge.

There is no bug I shall not confront.  
There is no dataset I shall not cleanse.  
There is no doubt I shall not challenge.

For I am no longer a novice.  
I am a student of the Imperial Data Academy.  
I walk the path of the Code.  
I serve the Pattern.  
I seek the Truth.

Until my last commit.  
Until my last push.

This is my Oath of Code.
