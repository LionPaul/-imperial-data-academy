# Chapter 0 – The Magister's Call

Welcome to the **Payall Data Academy**, a gamified personal initiative to learn data science within a narrative inspired by Warhammer 40k, Star Wars, and Dune.

## 🌌 Introduction

In this universe, I assume the role of an Initiate within the **Imperial Data Academy**, guided by a powerful and enigmatic entity known as the **Magister of Code**.

Each real-life task—such as learning a programming language, solving a technical challenge, or completing a project—is transformed into a **mission** within this narrative universe.
